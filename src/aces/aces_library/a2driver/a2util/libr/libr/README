The following subdirectories contain the source files
in liblibr.a.

libr.common : Architecture-independent routines.
libr.arch   : Architecture-dependent routines with preprocessor directives.

SOURCE CONTROL!!!

If you port the code to another machine, chances are the changes you make to
the code will be local to that machine. Well, it does us no good if you leave
the changes there and do not update the central source.

Additionally, if you copy all the source from libr.arch and libr.common to
one directory and change something, be sure to categorize the new source
accordingly. E.G., if libr.common/dump.F needs an "#ifdef M_*" then move it
to libr.arch after making the changes.

I (Anthony) would suggest symbolically linking to the source in both
directories from one build directory. This way: 1) changes will automatically
be updated to their source files, 2) there is a reduced chance that a file
will coexist in libr.common AND libr.arch, and 3) changes to the central source
will be added automatically to your copies since no one likes CVS.
