c This routine was the ACES initialization routine, but that function has been
c transferred to aces_init. However, this routine is not merely kept for
c compatibility. It is still needed to initialize some legacy common blocks;
c thus, removing them from the acescore namespace.

c NO NEW MEMBER EXECUTABLES SHOULD CALL THIS!

c To use the automatic memory allocation, IENTRY must be >= 0.
