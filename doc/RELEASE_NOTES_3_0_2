Release Notes for ACESIII version 3.0.2

1. Zero out scratch array used in eig.F routine.  This eliminates some prblems noted with inconsistencies in diagonalization results.

2. Remove and clean up some outdated code used in building the PST table.

3. Change SSCAL calls to DSCAL to eliminate confusion about use of this routine.

4. Old joda routines coarse_backup and coarse_restore have been modified to eliminate use of the C "system" call.

5. Removed the "create_window" SIAL language construct, changed sub_index to subindex. This work is in preparation for the next round of extensions to the SIAL language.

6. Remove occurrences of sub_index construct in SIAL programs.  Remove test_window.sial (obsolete program).

7. Change dimension of internal arrays in contract_blocks.f from 4 to 6.       

8. Fixed a memory-related bug in built_bgmtrx.F.  A scratch array was used in multiple ways, and an implicit assumption in its dimensions was that NRATOMS is less than or equal to TOTREDNCO/3. Now, the correct dimensions are always used. 

9. Added subindex capability to SIAL language and runtime.

10. Fix error in server: Delete instruction failed when running very tiny jobs with multiple servers.

11. Fix bug in reuse of scratch arrays in built_bgmtrx.  This could cause a job to incorrectly transform the Cartesian coords to internal coords at the end of a geometry step.

12. Fix logic in contract_blocks routine to allow contractions of type 
   2-index * 4-index -> 4-index as well as 
   4-index * 2-index -> 4-index.

13. Fixed gfortran (fortran compiler for gcc >= 4.0) problems in sip/open_amp (added filenames) and in geopt/assign_bonds (added length for integer output). 

14. Updated geopt/minv to use lapack routines instead of linpack/eispack routines 

15. Added preprocessor directive to main/sumz.c to comment out the inclusion of malloc.h when on an Apple computer. This file doesn't exist for modern Macs and the relevant routines are stored in other header files already included.

16. In nlo__analyze_rings there is a call to the non-fortran standard dacosd routine.  For gcc compilers, this routine does not exist.  Added preprocessor directive to include an external function that replicates its action for gcc based compilers. Change nlo__analyze_rings.f to nlo__analyze_rings.F

17. Added options for regularized LinCCSD.  The regularization is specified through the SIP section of the ZMAT

18. Added HF instability following capabilities.  This calls the sial code instab_scf_uhf_mo_ao.sio to determine whether or not there is an instability.  If there is (or dropmo is on) then it reruns the SCF code guess_scf_uhf_finish.sio with an initial guess from the instab routine, before proceeding to the correlation calculation. This required the addition of stabvalue as a global constant and several changes to main/beta.F

19. Merged in changes from port to tow (SGI-ICE) and surveyor (IBM Blue Gene/P) systems.

20.  Added tests and test_results for new SIAL codes (3.1.1.1-3.2.3.1).

21.  Fix bug causing crashes in SYMMETRY routine during geometry optimizations on Crays (particularly einstein).
